			<p>
				I am an Assistant Professor and Director of Clinical Research in the <a href="http://keck.usc.edu/en/Education/Academic_Department_and_Divisions/Department_of_Radiology">Department of Radiology</a> at the <a href="http://keck.usc.edu/">Keck School of Medicine (KSOM)</a> of <a href="http://www.usc.edu/">USC</a>. I completed my Medical School from India in 2007 and joined the <a href="http://keck.usc.edu/">KSOM</a> as a student to gain specialized traning in clinical research. I completed my Masters in Clinical Research (tailored specifically for MDs who wish to build a career in research) from USC with focus on patient oriented translational research. I have extensive practical experience in imaging research (presented thesis based on NIH R01 project, "Role of FDG PET/CT in Prostate Cancer") and have been involved in numerous projects in collaborations with colleagues in the Department of Radiology as well as other departments at KSOM and other schools at USC. I have also been closely working with several junior and senior faculty in the Department of Radiology and helping them write up new research proposals which can lead to grant funding. I have also been successfully mentoring medical students in various aspects of research and helped them receive medical student research grants and scholarships. I have the necessary expertise and motivation to successfully lead the research division in the Department of Radiology.
